Edit this file to describe how to retrieve the data set. Except for very small data files, it's not recommended to check data into version control.

I uploaded a module that is located within the main repository called "Loading Data Module".  This module takes one of the trials used within the experiement and more specifically takes two of the keys from within the dictionary, "SpikeTime" and "PhotoTime".
I was able to retrieve this data by downloading the MatLab file from CRCNS website and running the LoadMat funciton within the data loading module.
