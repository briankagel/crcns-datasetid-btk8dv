# Computational Neuroscience Final Project

For my project, I will be analyzing the data set v2-1 provided from CRCNS of neuronal activity from the V2 system of the visual cortex.  This data is gained from well isolated neurons in the V2 region of macaque monkeys during the presentation of different visual stimuli with varying degrees of similarity in order to elicit responses of differing intensity.  My goal is to analyze these responses by organizing the responses by trail and experiment, for which I chose 2 experiments that both each contained many trials.  Once this is done, I will then perform various statistical analyses to compare the difference in response intensity compared to the coupled stimulus intensity to see if there are any noticible correlations either within trials or across trials.  The results of this data will hopefully provide some understanding into the dynamics of this recently discovered class of neurons as well as speak to the variability and accuracy of response intensity as it relates to stimulus presentation.  I thought this was particularly interesting as the primary literature then compares these V2 neurons to the preceding V1 to gauge the difference between the two.
